Chess-Solver
============

In this project I used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>Minimax algorithm</b></font></a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>Alpha-Beta pruning</b></font></a> to implement a chess solving algorithm. I tested it by writing a text based chess game in which moves are computed using the minimax algorithm I encoded. I developed this project using the Lisp programming language in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>GNU Emacs</b></font></a> Integrated Developers Environment. This program was initially developed for an Artificial Intelligence class with the help of a professor. I decided to develop and test it further after completion of the class requirements. I am still in the process of further development. <br>

I have included the source code Lisp file in this repository.
